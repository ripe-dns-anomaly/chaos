Goal: download measurement results (JSON format) from RIPE Atlas CHAOS queries towards a given service *that replies with unique strings*.

parse-json.sh is the main tool. It will download the JSON files, parse the content and compute the statistics needed for further anomaly detection.

Please look at the description in the header of parse-json.sh for guidelines on how to use it.

Live long and prosper
